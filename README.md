# kafka-consumer

This is the source code for a generic Kafka consumer. It should be available as a docker image with properties defined in the env variables for customising its behaviour.

# Getting Started
For testing purposes and quick access you can start a local stack containing Kafka, a [data generator](https://github.com/Stuzanna/kafka-data-generator), the consumer, and Conduktor Console for visualising and interacting with Kafka on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
Start with , `docker compose up -d`
